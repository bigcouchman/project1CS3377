# This program extracts date from the user's input of a text file. The script name is project1.sh
# Before starting the program.
# Please read the instruction below:
# 1. Type in bash project1.sh
# 2. A prompt will appear on the console "Hello! This program detects all dates in a text file. Enter a file name: "
#    - Enter the file name that you want to extract the dates from. (Type in the exact file that you want to have the dates to appear and have that file ready! Ex: input.txt). Press Enter.
# 3. Another prompt will appear on the console "Now enter a file name that you want the dates to appear in: "
#    - Enter the file name that you want to show the dates on. (Type in the exact file that you want to have the dates to appear and have that file ready! Ex: output.txt). Press Enter.
# 4. After Step 3, nothing should appear in the console. The dates will show on the output file you have selected in Step 3. The program extracts all of the possible date formats (to my knowledge) from your input file and the output displays these dates. Beneath you have the date count, showing how many dates appear in the file.

# MAIN CONCEPTS
